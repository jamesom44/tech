            <p><B>There are three kinds of HTML elements: normal elements, raw text elements, and void elements. Normal elements usually have both a start tag and an end tag, although for some elements the end tag, or both tags, can be omitted.HTML tags are the keywords on a web page that define how your web browser must format and display your web page.
